- 👋 Hi, I’m @AmauryDanisCousandier
- 👀 I’m interested in Code, Travels, to cook but mostly in retrogaming !
- 🌱 I’m currently learning things @ Ahlia university (Epitech 4th year abroad program), react-native, postgresql, Nest
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for the moment, I will try to complete my master as effectively as possible while doing my own projects
